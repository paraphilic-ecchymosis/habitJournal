# Habit Journal

This Maven project originated as the capstone project for my BS in Comp. Science at
Stevens Henager College, graduated July of 2020.

# 2022 Update
Resurrecting this project to update codebase to current knowledge of
 development practices. The original intent of the project is to serve
as an online habit tracking platform that is gender neutral and accommodating
to those with sensory related overstimulation.
